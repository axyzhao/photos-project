      <h3> Photographs of Tsinghua in May </h3>
      <p className="caption"> <a href="https://alzhao.com">Alex Zhao</a> // May 9, 2022 </p>
      <p>
        On May 7, two of my classmates in Schwarzman, Lujain and Lucia, organized a photograph activity where we split into groups and took pictures around Tsinghua University's campus.
      The campus is locked down, so we were limited to our area of Tsinghua. We were each given eight prompts and two hours to take pictures. At the end, we shared our photos with all.
      Below are our photos - thanks Lena and Yucheng!

        "Capture - contrast. We interviewed Mr. Du, 61, a cleaner at the university. He spends 8 hours daily cleaning the pond and enjoys his work. A few steps away, we came across a robot designed by engineering students to skim the pond for leaves.",
        "When asked, Mr. Du described the robot as a mere toy. We settled on the name River Runner 2049 for the composition."

          "This is called A Squirrel's Life. Also, please let me know if these mushrooms are edible. I've already eaten four, and they're definitely not portobellos."

          "In Journey to the West, Sun Wukong is king of the Cave Behind the Water Curtain (水帘洞). I have always been fascinated by the existence of separate worlds hidden behind obvious doors. Hence, we titled this Water Curtain. "

          "The boy was full of life, curious about every nook and cranny in the landscape, and bounding across the grass. The university has many such families who live in apartments within campus. Hence, we called this photo Growing Up or 长大."

          "We titled this Neo-Confucianism. I must disclaim this by saying that I am not a Confucian disciple. I find that Chinese people are historically minded and frequently draw inspiration from the past. Confucius has disciples over 2,000 years later."

          "Children are often found jumproping, playing tag, or kicking a shuttlecock. The elderly form choirs, traditional music bands, and dancing groups. We titled the photo Spring."

          "In China, cameras perch on artificial saplings on street corners and by buildings. Guards are omnipresent in public places. For the May 1 Holiday, students gathered outside - as did the guards. We titled this photograph The Third Eye."
